UCB Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 6 API Challenge

## Installation

Software Jupyter Notebook is being used to write the code, and to generate the results, and the environment is PythonDataUCB, provided by UC Berkeley.


## Description

This is the Module 6 challenge for the UC Berkeley Data Analyticd Boot Camp. We are using the OpenWeather API and Geoapify API for data to be used in this analysis.

The first part of the analysis is on weather, with the help of the OpenWeather API and the Citipy package with Python. Citipy was first used to generate a random list of cities, then with OpenWeather API, we can pull information on the city list, such as the latitiude, longtitude, country code, and weather information. With this information, scatter plots are made based on the coordinates and the weather information of the cities. Finally, correlations between the weather and the coordinates of the cities are also being investiagted.

For the second part of the analysis, we were to plan for a future vacation with the cities from the list of random cities made in the first analysis. We first did some cleaning on the city list according to our preference on our destinations, such as the range of maximum temperature, or the wind speed. With the help of Geoapify API, we were able to find the hotel closest to the cities.
